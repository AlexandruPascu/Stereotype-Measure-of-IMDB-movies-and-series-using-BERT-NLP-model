        "\n",
        "> This notebook contains complete code to fine-tune the transformers language model BERT to perform categorization of movies and series into a label especially the probability of them being a Stereotype title. We will use BERT to categorize titles from IMDB datasets in stereotypes and non-stereotypes (the categories can be easily changed for other usecases). Data needed for this matter is the users keywords of titles and plots (we are excluding game-show, talk-show, reality-tv and filtering for drama and comedy. We are including only episodes with at least 1 rating for relevance). BigQuery has been used for some data cleaning purposes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**In this notebook, you will:**\n",
        "\n",
        "> Download and load a dataset of series title episodes with various information about them such as actors, production, ratings, plots, keywords and others. Based on the users existing keywords titles will be put into a category (easily changeble) and used for training and then labeling others (keywords can be changed and use in different ways). The dataset was created from the Goodreads dataset. Load a BERT model from the Transformers Library, build your own model by combining BERT with a classifier. Train your own model on a GPU, fine-tuning BERT on the training dataset. Use the trained model to classify titles as Stereotype using plots. Use the predicted categorization probabilities to run regressions and find insights. You can use this notebook on your own data from other domains and categories, by ensuring that your input and prediction datasets have the same structure and column names as those provided with this notebook. Alternatively the later can be modified as well to suit your use-case."
